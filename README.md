## The Process of Creation
It all started with simple challenge, *build a keylogger from scratch*. Since I was looking for a way to test my python skills I accepted the challenge.
And so was born the SilverHeart program. After some work *(20 hours of work,  distribuited by 10 days, and many documentation reading)* the open source keylogger is ready to be released in is the Alpha Version.
